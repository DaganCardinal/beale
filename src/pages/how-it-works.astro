                The Beale Cipher is a book cipher, which is fairly simple,
                though tedious, to solve once you have the key. <br />Of course,
                the trouble in the case of the Beale Ciphers is <i>finding</i> the
                key

                <p>A book cipher might look something like this:</p>

                    class="mt-3 mx-auto border-2 border-stone-300 w-full lg:w-96 rounded p-3"

                    In order to solve this you'll need the key, in this case we
                    will use the Declaration of Independance, which can <a

                    see above, our cipher's highest number is 302, so I've only
                    included the relevant text below.

                    When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for
                    one people to dissolve the political bands which have
                    connected them with another, and to assume among the powers
                    of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the
                    Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
                    respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
                    declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We
                    hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
                    created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
                    certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
                    Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these
                    rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their
                    just powers from the consent of the governed, --That
                    whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these
                    ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
                    it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation
                    on such principles and organizing its powers in such form,
                    as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and
                    Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments
                    long established should not be changed for light and
                    transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn,
                    that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
                    sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms
                    to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of
                    abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object
                    evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it
                    is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
                    Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
                    security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these
                    Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains
                    them to alter their former Systems of Government. The
                    history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of
                    repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
                    object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these
                    States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid
                    world.
